# Spam Detector App

Welcome to the Spam Detector App by Streaks V.2! This simple yet powerful application helps you identify whether a given text message is spam or not. The app utilizes a pre-trained model that has been designed to learn from user contributions, allowing it to adapt and improve over time.

## Key Features

### 1. Spam Detection
Easily enter a text message, and the app will provide you with an instant prediction on whether it is likely to be spam or not.

### 2. User Contribution
You have the power to contribute to the improvement of the spam detection model! By providing your data anonymously, you help the model learn from a wider range of examples, making it more robust and accurate.

### 3. Self-Updating Model
The app is designed to update its model based on user contributions. This means that as more users contribute data, the model learns new patterns and improves its accuracy in identifying spam messages.

### 4. Contribution Logging
All user contributions are logged in a hidden CSV file (`contributions.csv`), ensuring privacy and accountability. You can't view the file in the repo due to privacy concerns but it can be shown upon personal request.

## How to Contribute

1. Click on the "Contribute!" button to expand the sidebar.
2. Enter the text message you want to contribute along with its label (Spam or Not Spam).
3. Click on "Finish Contribution" to save your contribution.
4. Thank you for helping improve the accuracy of the model!

## Model Retraining

The app periodically retrains its model with the accumulated user contributions. This means that the model gets better over time as it learns from new data.

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for future versions of the app! We are actively working on introducing more features and improvements to enhance your experience in identifying spam messages.

## Note of Caution

While the app is effective, it may still have limitations in correctly identifying certain types of messages. Your contributions are crucial in overcoming these limitations and enhancing the app's performance.
